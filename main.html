    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It is crucial for determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of processing time as the input size grows. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm requires relative to the input size. Typically, it is expressed using Big O notation such as O(n). Minimizing space complexity is important for optimizing memory usage.
